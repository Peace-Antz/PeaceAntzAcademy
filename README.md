Title: "Decentralized School Contract for Online Learning and Talent Scouting"

Introduction:

The decentralized school contract is a smart contract that facilitates online learning and talent scouting by connecting teachers, sponsors, and students on the blockchain. The contract allows teachers to set up and market their courses off-chain, while providing an on-chain mechanism for sponsorship and staking. The contract also enables students to learn important skills for free if they complete the course, while providing sponsors with an opportunity to scout talent after the course.

Features:

Teachers can get paid by sponsors to teach courses. They are responsible for setting up and marketing their courses off-chain. The on-chain portion of the contract is the sponsorship amount, which determines the staking amount for the student to prevent teachers from paying themselves.
Sponsors can scout talent after the course or just people who want to learn too.
Students can learn important skills for free if they complete the course, if they don't complete it they have to pay (staked funds).
Teachers are required to make POAPs for each class before hand and give these addresses to "the school contract" in order to make a course. This will set the length of the course. Teachers can determine milestones for students to get back a portion of staked funds if desired, as well as the attendance rate a student needs to pass.
Teachers can sign the contract for each student when/if they pass to release staked funds and some sort of certificate of completion NFT.
Students have to stake funds to officially be admitted into the classes
Anyone (student/teachers/other) can sponsor a course. Teachers cannot be students and visa versa.
Once a teacher creates a course, it gets posted for students to register for by staking their funds to show general interest in course. Sponsors will come in and sponsor courses they want to take or recruit talent on. Once a course is sponsored it can begin. Once the course is complete, teachers get paid out at once or according to milestones. Students get paid out their staked amount and submit an on-chain review of the course and sponsors can build away. NFTs with course details are distributed to students, teachers and sponsors.
Benefits:

The contract provides a decentralized and transparent mechanism for online learning and talent scouting.
Teachers can earn money for teaching courses, while students can learn important skills for free if they complete the course.
Sponsors can scout talent and invest in skills they want to hire.
The use of POAPs and NFTs ensure the authenticity of the course and completion certificates.
Implementation:

The contract can be implemented on any blockchain platform that supports smart contracts, such as Ethereum. The contract can be written in Solidity or any other programming language that is supported by the chosen blockchain platform.

Conclusion:

The decentralized school contract is an innovative solution that can revolutionize the way we think about online learning and talent scouting. It provides a transparent, decentralized and efficient mechanism for connecting teachers, sponsors, and students on the blockchain. The contract can benefit all parties involved, and it can be easily implemented on any blockchain platform that supports smart contracts.

Please note that this is a rough proposal, with more research and development required to build a full-featured and functional smart contract.
